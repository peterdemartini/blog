I work with some awesome people at [Octoblu](http://octoblu.com/). Jade Meskill and Roy Van De Water have had some influence on my latest train of thoughts. I read an [article](http://integrumtech.com/2014/01/the-value-of-values/) that they wrote a while back and it had me thinking.

**What are my values?**

It is hard question to answer; I value many things. So I have spent some time thinking and I decided upon 5 values or principles.

1. **Love** - not only does this influence empower greatness, it brings joy to those touched by it. It is the foundation of nearly every positive quality.
2. **Trust** - believing in people, not only strengthens your relationship but can help them have faith in themselves.
3. **Patience** - people often underestimate the value of patience. Its counterpart, frustration can bring the best person to make irrational and illogical decisions.
4. **Insight** - without luck, you cannot solve a problem without understanding. You must seek to learn and grow. Knowledge is power.
5. **Courage** - everybody has a valuable opinion, having the strength to speak up and take action is key to building a strong team.
