Have you looked back on a piece of code you wrote 3 years ago and said, **"What the hell was I thinking?"** Well that happens to a lot of developers, and I am one of them.

### The Problem

My code is never good enough, for me at least. But that is not the problem, and I will get into that in a moment. The problem is I am learning tons every day and it isn't fast enough.

I am already dedicating most my time to learn and applying my knowledge in work and projects. The questions are, how I do learn faster? I do not think I have enough time in the day to do everything I need to do. I can't sacrifice sleep and a social life, since I think there is a need for a well balanced life.

### Looking Back

When recalling that old code, you should see flaws. If you can make improvements, it means you have learned something. If this happens repeatedly, then great, you haven't ceased learning.

In my opinion **"perfect code"** rarely exists. Best practices are changing, like knowledge should. People make mistakes. People rush things. This is natural, the key is to learn from it, and always build.

### The Apex

If you reach an apex, get back in school. You should always be achieving something higher. Knowledge is endless. There can be more and there will be more.

### The Solution

Never stop learning, and always judge your work, even if you once thought it was flawless. Don't get cocky. Once that happens, you will not improve.
