**As much as some people would like to think, learning can't be a part-time mindset,** knowledge changes every day. If you want to be successful in the many industries, go out and learn something new. While I admit, not learning at all is worse than only *some* of the time. I am convinced that achieving anything beyond the standard dreams, is nearly impossible without desire and passion to learn.

> In theory and short of constants, what was, what is, and what will be, cannot be the same.

If something is ever changing, and you don't give it your all. **Your knowledge will exponentially deteriorate, rendering your ability to provide technical expertise inert.** Even with a college degree and years of experience, you could be running on a treadmill. What would be tragic would be learning and forgetting. Don't let the power of knowledge pass you by.

#### Learn anything and everything

If you don't have a passion to learn, I won't hire you. Without a doubt, learning is the most powerful tool. With the massive amount of information, that fluctuates in an unpredictable pattern, a part-time attitude isn't an option. By the time you learn something new, expect it to change and learn it again. What you learned 10 years ago, is still a valuable asset, but in technical aspects, it is expected to have changed. What they teach at school, should be changing every day. It should adopt the rapid evolution of knowledge. Even what has been told in history books, could be proven to be incorrect. Don't plan for the future, adapt to it; it is an unpredictable beast.

#### Learn every day

I can't tell you the last day I didn't try to learn something new. As a result, every day my experience and knowledge have increased. Over the period of a lifetime, greatness is the only option. I don't have a particularly gifted mind, but I do know the determination to learn anything and everything possible. Therefore I will continue growing, my skill set will only get better.

#### Why not part-time?

When I say part-time, I don't mean a part-time job. Sometimes you need to take what you can get. What I am referring to is putting half of your effort into it. The only thing you are doing when you don't take this seriously, is putting yourself behind the curve. What you are doing is limiting your ability to achieve greatness. Greatness isn't about making a lot of money but changing the world. Make a difference, even if it is just small group of people.

#### What you need to be doing

You need to be reading, anything from quotes to articles to books. Challenge everything; second guess what you have always believed or have been told to be true. Don't stop. Do NOT fear failure for it is only possible if you don't try or give up. Having above standard intelligence is a plus, but without learning, you will not grow. In the sense of knowledge, you forever infant.

#### An impossible task

Ever-changing vast amounts of information. Doesn't that sound like an endless task? It is, but let your gravestone be your diploma. Once you begin learning, the task becomes more enjoyable than a daunting chore. Let the impossible be part of your every day life. If you have that attitude achieving the impossible seems that much more possible.
