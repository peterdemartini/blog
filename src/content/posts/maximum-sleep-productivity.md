Staying productive throughout the day, for me, is the difference between night and day. If I wake up early, and produce results all day, I am happy and feel great. If I sleep in, I am most likely to lethargic, and unmotivated.

So I have always tried to wake up early and stay productive all day. This easily boosts my mood and makes me feel fulfilled.

Some people are not easily affected by sleep and others are night owls. If you are among those, then this article isn't meant for you.

The goal is tantamount to start a regular sleep pattern. Going to sleep at 9pm one night and 2am another, will throw it off. You have an obligation to keep it consistent.

Find your sweet spot. There are a number of variations when it comes to how much sleep you need. The key is to find the spot you could wake up in the morning, without the need to have recourse asleep. If you need to go to bed earlier, do that.

I have discovered that if I get some sleep 10pm, I can easily be up around 6am. It needs to be able to repeat this habit on a daily basis. Inconsistent sleep patterns can make it difficult.

Once you get use to going to bed at a specific time and waking up early, the next step is to trigger your brain to wake up. You need to associate doing something to wake up, for most people this means coffee. But for some, this means taking a dog for a walk, exercising, showering or making breakfast. If you can make the association between waking up and doing something, you'll not are able to wake up earlier but you'll be more productive.

The final step is to trick your brain you want to wake up. If you want to wake up early every morning you be more motivated and be able to power through being tired.
