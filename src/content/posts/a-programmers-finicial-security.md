### Introduction

I am developer and **my job varies**, there are slow times and there are times when I work ~90 hours a week. Naturally the question arises, what do you do to make your income more consistent? The answer comes in two parts, passive income and saving.

### Passive Income

**What is passive income?** Passive income is income received on a regular basis.

The key is to create a desirable product or service and receive income with minimal work. The benefit of passive income is that you are taking an inconsistent income and adding an additional source of money to smooth out the slow times.

**What do you create?** It could be anything, it could be a custom theme, a plugin, a module, or an app of some sort. The important thing to remember is to create something that doesn't require a lot of time to maintain since you won't always have time to do that. It is also key to remember to keep this product for a minimal price and go for consistent purchases.

### Saving

Now here is my personal preference for saving money. Take the concepts, and apply it to any financial situation.

**Don't think about fixed amounts.** When your income changes dramatically every month, don't think about saving **x** amount every month. Think about percentages. You should be saving **AT LEAST %10** of your income every month. When you make a lot of money, save a lot money.

**Don't touch it.** It is important to save money and not lose that money. If you are immediately spending the money you are "putting away" then you aren't really saving. When you put money away, put it away for a rainy day or save it until you reach a goal and then spend a portion of it. Never spend all of your money, or you will lose your job security.

**When is enough?** You can always save money, but a good rule of thumb would the length of time it would take you to find a new job in a bad market. Sometimes that is 3 months, other times it is more than year.

**Don't spend more than you make.** Whether you are making a lot of money or a very little, keep your spending well below the amount you make making. Although, there will be times when that is impossible or hard to do.

### Conclusion

Distribute your income and consistently save and invest as much as possible.
