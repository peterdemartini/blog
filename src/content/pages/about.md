My name is Peter DeMartini, I am a software engineer on the Octoblu team at Citrix. My job and my passion is to create things; the more projects I have, the better. I have a lovely wife, two crazy dogs, and an old truck that consumes too much time and money. Most days I can be found in Phoenix Arizona.
